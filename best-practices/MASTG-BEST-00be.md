### Recommendation

WebViews in Android allow applications to render web content, but they can introduce significant security risks if not properly managed.

Whenever possible, follow the guidance in @MASTG-BEST-0012. 

Additionally, load only static WebViews packaged within the app bundle, and do not load resources or link (redirect) to external domains. This approach ensures that the displayed content cannot be tampered with remotely.

If your application must display dynamic web content from the internet, ensure that all websites loaded in your WebView are secure and under your organization's control (or at least within your organization's trust boundaries).

When you need to load partial resources (especially JavaScript files) or even full websites outside your organisation's trust boundaries, do not load them directly into a WebView. Instead, open the website in the user's default browser or use safer alternatives such as [Trusted Web Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/app-bundle/trusted-web-activities) or [Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/overview/). These solutions leverage the browser's isolated environment.

To enforce domain control and prevent untrusted content from loading inside your app, apply a control like the following:

```kotlin
webView.webViewClient = object : WebViewClient() {
    override fun shouldOverrideUrlLoading(
        view: WebView?,
        request: WebResourceRequest?
    ): Boolean {
        val url = request?.url.toString()
        Log.d("WebView", "About to load: $url")

        // You can intercept or allow it:
        val outsideControl = isOutsideControl(url)
        if(outsideControl){
            // Handle the case where the URL is outside your control
            // For example, open it in the default browser instead
            val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url))
            context.startActivity(intent)
        }
        return outsideControl // return true if you want to handle it manually
    }
}

fun isOutsideControl(url: String): Boolean {
    val trustedDomains = listOf("https://my-domain.com", "https://another-trusted-domain.com")
    return trustedDomains.none { url.startsWith(it) }
}
```
